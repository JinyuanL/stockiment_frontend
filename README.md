# Frontend for stockiment

In the modern age of investing, the availability of data on investor sentiment allows us to extrapolate future buying and selling decisions based on mass media. In this project, we will attempt to use sentiment analysis to predict stock market valuation in the short term.
  1. We are performing NLP analysis on Tweets relevant to the stock/company.
  2. Using these quantitative results from the NLP analysis we will attempt to predict the value of the stock in the near     future.
  3. Inform users of the stocks that we predict will go up or down.
  4. Provide users with trending tweets about each company to provide further insight and relevant news.
